• Made a script so we don't have to add google-modules 1 by 1. This will also update the tags for the modules to whatever you set it as in the script.

• Working on adding other things to the script such as cloning device/source repos, cherry-pick/merge script, automatic uploads on successful builds, etc!

To run this script:
1. give it permission by chmod +x (whatever you named the script)
2. type ./(name of script) to run it
3. watch the magic happen
